# Overview

::: warning
**Please note we will reset the test network around every two weeks, the data and test assets on the test network may be
periodically cleared, and please do not rely on Greenfield to save important data on the test network.**

Greenfield is a decentralized storage infrastructure within the broader BNB chain ecosystem where users and dApps can
create, store, and exchange data with full ownership to form a new data economy. BNB remains the main utility token on
Greenfield, which can be used to pay the gas fee and storage fees.

There is a native cross-chain bridge between Greenfield and BSC (BNB Smart Chain), and BNB can be transferred between BSC
and Greenfield. For more details about the cross-chain, you can refer to [Cross Chain](./greenfield-blockchain/modules/cross-chain.md).

Greenfield defines its account in the same format as BSC and Ethereum, with this compatible address scheme, you can
reuse existing accounts and infrastructure from BSC. For example, you can use TrustWallet, Metamask or other
compatible wallets to deposit your BNB from BSC to Greenfield and interact with dApps on Greenfield. It is also easy
to identify the same owner by referring to the same addresses on both BSC and Greenfield.
